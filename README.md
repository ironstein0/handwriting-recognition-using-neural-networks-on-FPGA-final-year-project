# handwriting-recognition-using-neural-networks-on-FPGA-final-year-project
My final Year project, involving a neural network and image processing based system for handwriting recognition.

Working on an FPGA implementation for the same.

This is work in Progress.

Done in collaboration with [dhr9](https://github.com/dhr9), for the other half of this project, please visit [this page](https://github.com/dhr9)
